###  Github repo. 

* OFTEIN Multi Tenant Portal
This repository runs automated build to create docker images for Multi Tenant Portal Frontend and Backend Apps.
url: https://github.com/OFTEIN-NET/OFTEIN-MultiTenantPortal

* Github repo for front-end maintained by Usman, url: https://github.com/smartx-usman/multi-tenant-portal-frontend

* Github repo for back-end  mantained by Natt/Kittitpat, url: https://github.com/NattVi/OFTEIN-PlusPlus/tree/master/Demo

## Discussion Topics

1. Multi tenant portal : 
  (1) create script/docker compose to run both back-end and front-end together... 
  (2) deploy both in one server (Chula server or Google Cloud instance)... 
  (3) test check the cluster status and create pod from the frond-end, not back-end

1. Worker node integration progress and issues: Myanmar, Bhutan, Vietnam, India??

1. Other topics (optional): Kubeflow, intelligence path services, and other services.


## 1.1, 1.2 - Multi tenant portal
* Edit api spec for pod creation - Kittipat
  - [PUT] to create a pod from yaml, userid, cluster
  - [GET] list pod from specific cluster

* Finalize and update cluster name list ([Chula, UM, Gist]) - Kittipat

* Cooperate token from Gist site - Natt
* Create monthly report - Kittipat/ Natt
* Follow contract - Pattarasak

* Review https://github.com/OFTEIN-NET/OFTEIN-MultiTenantPortal/pull/10/files# - Kittipat


## 1.3 - Multi tenant portal : (3) test check the cluster status and create pod from the frond-end, not back-end

* Add functionality to create pods from frontend application 

* Update calls to backend application APIs to get deployed Pods and cluster info 

* Assist the test deployment of frontend application into Google cloud / VM with Chula team 


### 2 - Worker node integration progress and issues:

* Worker for these sites are ready : Myanmar (2), Bhutan (1), Monash, Indonesia, taiwan, UM
* Worker nodes for Vietnam site is not Ready due to unavailablity of connection

### 3 -Other topics: Kubeflow (GIST)


* Setup: 
  - Create Cluster on gist-OpenStack Machine
  - Deploying with minikube on a single node (Next Multinode using worker nodes)
  - Installed KubeFlow

* MNIST Experiment
  - Launch Kubeflow Dashboard
  - Creatre Note Book on Kubeflow Assign resources
  - Running the MNIST on jupyter notebook

* Next Steps
  - Deploy the Model as usable for the cluster (deployed in GIST and accessable)
  - Run the experiment using GPU enabled nodes and make it available.
  - dataset: Measurement/Monitoring Visibility
  
 * Comments
  - Share the Data feed in to the experiment. (Flow layer Dataset on GitHub)
  - Make Instructions how to use the data for users.
 
 Leveraging the exisiting surface how we can
  - How to deploy in our existing cluster.
  - Define scripts/configruation for anyone to deploy on other cluster
  - Give options for GPU enabled deployment.
  - Running on single node Vs Running on multiple nodes
