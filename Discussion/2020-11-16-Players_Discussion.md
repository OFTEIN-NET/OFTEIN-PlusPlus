## 1 - Discussion from last Ambassadors and Players Meeting

1. For multi-portal deployment we will temporarily use Chula Site as host.

2- Provide proper naming for the Project and modules (e.g. demo).

3- Main concern is how to pass information from front-end and link it with the back-end.

4- As part of Integrated design it is suggested that both Sites update the design of “Multi-tenant Portal Design” and incorporate the changes. Alternatively add own design.
