# OF@TEIN++: Open Federated Playgrounds For AI-inspired SmartX Services

**OF@TEIN++ project** intends to leverage and enhance the successfully completed *OF@TEIN* (2012 to 2016) and *OF@TEIN+* (Asi@Connect 1st Call, August 2017 to May 2019) projects. *OF@TEIN: Toward an OpenFlow-enabled SDN (Software-Defined Networking) Infrastructure* over TEIN was one of e-TEIN projects sponsored by Korean Government via NIA (National Information Agency), launched in July 2012 and led by Prof. JongWon Kim from NetCS (Networked Computing Systems) Laboratory, GIST (Gwangju Institute of Science & Technology), Korea. This project has completed successfully with many success stories have been achieved by the collaborators. Following its success, *OF@TEIN+: Open/Federated Playgrounds for Future Networks* was successfully continued till May 2019 in order to further enhance, extend and expand OF@TEIN collaboration.

The core effort of the OF@TEIN++ project involves knowledge sharing between the ambassadors, players and students about new tools, programs and softwares while built-up technical skills and soft skills. Furthermore Monthly meetings between OF@TEIN++ Ambassadors, Players, and Students for exchange of ideas and views among the members on the activities are carried out.
 Major outcomes of the project includes Multi-tenant-portal Software Kubernetes backend development for containerised resource federation of OF@TEIN++ Platform that has been integrated with the frontend module. Using Kubernetes to deploy a Collaboration cluster setup, Integrate ONOS SDN-IP with RPKI and Containerized OVS and BGP configuration. 
 
 ## Outcomes:
  * Multi-tenant Portal Software (https://github.com/OFTEIN-NET/OFTEIN-MultiTenantPortal): 
    *	Frontend application developed by GIST Tower 
    *	Back-end application developed by CHLA Tower
  * ONOS SDN-IP with RPKI Integration
